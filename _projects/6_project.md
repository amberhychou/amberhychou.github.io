I co-chaired with another PhD student, Shanti Garman, to organize the <a href="https://www.ece.uw.edu/news-events/wafer/">WAFER conference</a> at UW ECE with 100+ attendees. The objective of this event is to highlight research conducted by women and non-binary individuals. Speaker of this event include faculty and industry leaders from Amazon, Boeing, Impinj, Meta, and Microsoft.
