We designed a multimodal interface, integrating surface EMG and an eye-tracking headset, capable of adapting to individuals across diverse human-computer tasks such as tracking, pointing, and drawing.

    (a) Overview of a closed-loop myoelectric interface that uses eye gaze for training an adaptive mapping to control an external device, such as a computer cursor or a robotic arm. (b) The user controls a cursor (white) to track a continuous target (red) on a computer screen using high-density surface electromyography (sEMG) on the forearm. Gaze data is collected with an eye-tracking headset and is used to train the adaptive algorithm.
