<p>Prior to UW, I received my B.S. and M.S. in Biological Systems Engineering from the University of California, Davis (UC Davis) in 2018 and 2020, respectively. My advisor is <a href="https://bae.ucdavis.edu/people/farzaneh-khorsandi">Dr. Farzaneh Khorsandi</a> in Bio. & Ag. Engineering (BAE). With the bioengineering degrees, I wish to resolve issues in the field of robotics, make progress toward sustainability, and boost social and economic equity. During my study, I developed and tested an <b>autonomously driven all-terrain vehicle (ATV)</b> in order to operate unmanned rollover simulations, which introduces a safer evaluation method for farmers to make choices over safety devices.</p> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168169922000527?via%3Dihub">Link to the publication</a>.
