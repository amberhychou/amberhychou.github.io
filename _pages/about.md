<p>Hi! I am <b>Amber Chou</b> (she/her). I am a Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Washington, Seattle (UW ECE), studying <b>human-machine interaction</b>. I am advised by <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/sburden/bio/">Dr. Sam Burden</a>. 

<p>My research interest lies in the intersection of neuroengineering and human-computer interaction -- I am interested in integrating physiological sensing, including peripheral neural signals, eye movements, and gestures, to understand motor control in human-machine interaction. I leverage control theory, data-driven algorithms, and insights from experiments to enhance the usability of <b>multimodal interfaces</b> for applications in assistive technology and rehabilitation.

<!-- investigating human sensorimotor control and applying the knowledge to improve current technologies in robotics and human-machine systems. My research leverages data‐driven algorithms and theoretical principles drawn from control theory and game theory to enhance the usability of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405896323001210?via%3Dihub">multimodal interfaces</a>. I am particularly focused on non‐invasive physiological sensing such as electromyography (EMG) and eye tracking for applications in assistive devices or rehabilitation. -->

<!-- my Ph.D. research leverages theoretical techniques from control theory and game theory and data-driven algorithms to synthesize interfaces that have multiple modalities and can adapt to users. This synthesis of knowledge and expertise is aimed at advancing the usability of multimodal interfaces, particularly through non‐invasive physiological sensing for neurorehabilitation. -->

<!-- improving the accessibility, robustness, and usability of human-machine interfaces --></p>
<!-- My advisor is <a href="https://bae.ucdavis.edu/people/farzaneh-khorsandi">Dr. Farzaneh Khorsandi</a> in Bio. & Ag. Engineering (BAE). With the bioengineering degrees, I wish to resolve issues in the field of robotics, make progress toward sustainability, and boost social and economic equity. During my study, I developed and tested an <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168169922000527?via%3Dihub">autonomously driven all-terrain vehicle (ATV)</a> in order to operate unmanned rollover simulations, which introduces a safer evaluation method for farmers to make choices over safety devices.</p> -->

<p>My publishing name is <b>Amber H.Y. Chou</b>. I'm on <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=7CyqZxIAAAAJ">Google Scholar</a> and <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1965-148X">ORCID</a>.</p>
<p>Prior to UW, I received my B.S. and M.S. in Biological Systems Engineering from the University of California, Davis (UC Davis) in 2018 and 2020, respectively. You can find my Master's research project <a href="https://amberhychou.github.io/projects/1_project/">here</a>. </p>
<p>My name in Mandarin is 周筱陽 (Ch-oh Hsiao Yang). I was born and raised in Miaoli and Taichung, Taiwan. I enjoy travelling, hiking, skiing, and spending time with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/choutingers_cats/?hl=en">my two cats</a>! 
<!-- My pronouns are she/her/hers.</p> -->

<!-- As an engineer, I believe that resolving human-related issues is one of the most direct ways to fulfill my goal of making a change in society. With the bioengineering degree, my passions are resolving issues in the field of robotics, making progress towards sustainability, and boosting social and economic equity. My long-term career goal is to become an experienced engineer in robotic fields such as autonomous automobile or bio-robotics, with a proficiency in project management. -->
