<p>Hi! I'm <b>Amber Chou</b>. I am a 4th year Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at the University of Washington, Seattle (UW), with a focus on <b>human-machine interaction</b>. 

<p>I am advised by <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/sburden/bio/">Dr. Sam Burden</a> in the UW ECE department. 

<p>My research interest lies in the intersection of bioengineering and electrical & computer engineering: I am broadly interested in investigating human sensorimotor control and applying the knowledge to improve current technologies in robotics and human-machine systems. My research leverages data‐driven algorithms and theoretical principles drawn from control theory and game theory to enhance the usability of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405896323001210?via%3Dihub">multimodal interfaces</a>. I am particularly focused on non‐invasive physiological sensing such as electromyography (EMG) and eye tracking for applications in rehabilitation.

<!-- my Ph.D. research leverages theoretical techniques from control theory and game theory and data-driven algorithms to synthesize interfaces that have multiple modalities and can adapt to users. This synthesis of knowledge and expertise is aimed at advancing the usability of multimodal interfaces, particularly through non‐invasive physiological sensing for neurorehabilitation. -->

<!-- improving the accessibility, robustness, and usability of human-machine interfaces --></p>
<p>Prior to UW, I received my B.S. and M.S. in Biological Systems Engineering from the University of California, Davis (UC Davis) in 2018 and 2020, respectively. My advisor is <a href="https://bae.ucdavis.edu/people/farzaneh-khorsandi">Dr. Farzaneh Khorsandi</a> in Bio. & Ag. Engineering (BAE). With the bioengineering degrees, I wish to resolve issues in the field of robotics, make progress toward sustainability, and boost social and economic equity. During my study, I developed and tested an <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168169922000527?via%3Dihub">autonomously driven all-terrain vehicle (ATV)</a> in order to operate unmanned rollover simulations, which introduces a safer evaluation method for farmers to make choices over safety devices.</p>
<p>My published name is <b>Amber H.Y. Chou</b>. I'm on <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=7CyqZxIAAAAJ">Google Scholar</a> and <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1965-148X">ORCID</a>.</p>
<p>My name in Mandarin is 周筱陽 (Ch-oh Hsiao Yang). I was born and raised in Miaoli and Taichung, Taiwan. I enjoy travelling, hiking, skiing, and playing with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/choutingers_cats/?hl=en">my two cats</a>! My pronouns are she/her/hers.</p>
<!-- As an engineer, I believe that resolving human-related issues is one of the most direct ways to fulfill my goal of making a change in society. With the bioengineering degree, my passions are resolving issues in the field of robotics, making progress towards sustainability, and boosting social and economic equity. My long-term career goal is to become an experienced engineer in robotic fields such as autonomous automobile or bio-robotics, with a proficiency in project management. -->
