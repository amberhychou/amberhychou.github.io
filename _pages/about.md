<p>Hi! I'm Amber Hsiao-Yang Chou. I am a Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at the University of Washington, Seattle (UW) focusing on <b>human-machine interaction</b>. I am advised by <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/sburden/bio/">Dr. Sam Burden</a> in UW ECE. My research interest lies in the intersection of bioengineering and electrical & computer engineering: I am broadly interested in investigating human sensorimotor control and applying the knowledge toward enhancing the current technologies in robotics, human/machine systems, and VR/AR. Specifically, my proposed Ph.D. research leverages theoretical techniques from control theory and game theory and data-driven algorithms to synthesize interfaces that have multiple modalities and can adapt to users.
<!-- improving the accessibility, robustness, and usability of human-machine interfaces --></p>
<p>I received my B.S. and M.S. in Biological Systems Engineering from the University of California, Davis (UC Davis) in 2018 and 2020, respectively. My advisor is <a href="https://bae.ucdavis.edu/people/farzaneh-khorsandi">Dr. Farzaneh Khorsandi</a> in Bio. & Ag. Engineering (BAE). With the bioengineering degrees, I wish to resolve issues in the field of robotics, make progress toward sustainability, and boost social and economic equity. During my study, I developed and tested an autonomously driven all-terrain vehicle (ATV) in order to operate unmanned rollover simulations, which introduces a safer evaluation method for farmers to make choices over safety devices.</p>
<p>My published name is <b>Amber H.Y. Chou</b>. I'm on <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=7CyqZxIAAAAJ">Google Scholar</a> and <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1965-148X">ORCID</a>.</p>
<p>I was born and raised in Miaoli and Taichung, Taiwan. I enjoy skiing, paddle boarding, and travelling. My pronouns are she/her/hers.</p>
<!-- As an engineer, I believe that resolving human-related issues is one of the most direct ways to fulfill my goal of making a change in society. With the bioengineering degree, my passions are resolving issues in the field of robotics, making progress towards sustainability, and boosting social and economic equity. My long-term career goal is to become an experienced engineer in robotic fields such as autonomous automobile or bio-robotics, with a proficiency in project management. -->
