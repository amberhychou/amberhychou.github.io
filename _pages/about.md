<p>Hi! I am <b>Amber Chou</b> (she/her). I am a final year Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Washington, Seattle (UW ECE), studying <b>human-machine interaction</b>. 
  
<p> <ins><b>I am on academic job market and seeking opportunities for postdoctoral and faculty positions!</b></ins>

<p>My research interest lies in the intersection of human-robot/computer interaction and neuroengineering -- I am interested in integrating <b>wearable sensing</b>, including peripheral neural signals, eye movements, haptics, and gestures, to understand complex human behaviors. I leverage control theory, data-driven algorithms, and insights from experiments to design personalized <b>multimodal interfaces</b> for device-assisted rehabilitation. I am advised by <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/sburden/bio/">Dr. Sam Burden</a>. Here is a <a href="https://amberhychou.github.io/assets/pdf/Amber_Chou_1page_research_statement.pdf">1-page research statement</a> if you are interested in learning more about my work! 

<p>My publishing name is <b>Amber H.Y. Chou</b>. I'm on <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=7CyqZxIAAAAJ">Google Scholar</a> and <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1965-148X">ORCID</a>.</p>
<p>Prior to UW, I received my B.S. and M.S. in Biological Systems Engineering from the University of California, Davis (UC Davis) in 2018 and 2020, respectively. You can find my Master's research project <a href="https://amberhychou.github.io/projects/1_project/">here</a>. </p>
<p>My name in Mandarin is 周筱陽 (Ch-oh Hsiao Yang). I was born and raised in Miaoli and Taichung, Taiwan. I enjoy travelling, hiking, skiing, and spending time with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/choutingers_cats/?hl=en">my two cats</a>!
